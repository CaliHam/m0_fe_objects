# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
    - At first, running into challenges was very overwhelming and I would get stressed out easily. But I feel much more confident now, even when I run into challenges, I have a great support system to help me through.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
    - It's going fairly well. Some work is taking longer than I thought which stresses me out, but I can rearrange my schedule and it all works out.
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
    - That I have plenty of solid resources to go to when times get tough.
